## kbrenders.com - an automatic 3D rendering service for keycap designers (x-post /r/keycapdesigners)

I just built a new cloud service that will 3D render your keyboard-layout-editor keycap set designs within 24 hours - check it out at [kbrenders.com](http://www.kbrenders.com/). It's free for now, though I may have to charge if server costs get out of hand.

Currently, it supports two keyboard layouts and two keycap profiles, and only legends that are visible in kle-render will show. Compared to kle-render, final output is much more realistic due to kbrenders actually ray tracing every request in blender, instead of compositing 2d images. Try it out and tell me what you think! I'd especially appreciate any feedback on what new features would be most important for keycap set designers.
